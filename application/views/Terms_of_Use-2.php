If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, Company will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: justify;">where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in United States County, State of Connecticut.

If this Section is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Company will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this Section found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and you and Company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</span></p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CORRECTIONS</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: justify;">Occasionally there may be information on the Sites that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions that may relate to service descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other information.
